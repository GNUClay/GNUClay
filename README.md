I develop just for fun a small expert system based on the principles of Prolog.

Pure Prolog has a very minimalistic syntax.
As a result, the writing on it complicated programs generates large amounts of code.
As the result of it, many people are working on the improvement of the Prolog.
For example, Reiter's default logic or Stanford certainty factor.
I want to add some of these improvements to my system.

Now the logical programming and expert systems are used by large corporations, serious scientists and geeks enthusiasts-amateurs.
I dream of a greater use of logic programming.
I think, that there is great potential for the use of logic programming in the writing game characters with complex behavior, and chatbots.
I have published the minimal realization of my production system.
In the future, I will add different features to my system and to fix them in the new intermediate versions.
So, my system may be used in the early stages of its development, starting from the very first its version.
